					<h4><b>Dave R.</b></h4>
						<p>"Stunning ruins and great voladores show right outside. I recommend springing for the tour guide 
						inside the park. Super informative and friendly (we did ours in Spanish, but I’m sure 
						the English tours are excellent, too). Wear a hat and bring water!"</p>
